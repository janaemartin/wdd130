        <p>Hello! My name is Janae Martin and I am from Snowflake, Arizona. I like to draw and paint as well as play my
            violin in my free time. I am currently learning Software Development and hope to expand my knowledge on
            computers through these courses. I also like to tinker with and fix electronics and hope to make a
            career out of it in the future.</p>
